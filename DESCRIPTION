Title: Programmatically generate interfaces to C routines and data structures
   that are accessed dynamically via Rffi
Author: Duncan Temple Lang
Imports: methods, utils
Depends: methods, RGCCTranslationUnit, Rffi
Suggests: RAutoGenRunTime
Note:  If one does not use the define function to create
    working code from the generated templates within the R session in which 
    one creates the templates, then RAutoGenRunTime is not needed.
    Currently, we need Rffi at code generation time as we use the 
    type objects it provides. This may change in the future.

Description: This package allows us to programmatically read C code
  to get descriptions of routines and data types and then
  generate R code and class definitions that  allow us to 
  invoke those routines and access the contents of the 
  native data structures all using R code and Rffi.
  So there is no need to explicitly compile C code
  for each routine or data structure.

Note: We can also use the RGCCTranslationUnit package
  to generate C code that interfaces to the routines
  and data structures. That has some advantanges.
   The bindings provide better type checking
  and are probably slightly faster.
  The approach here is for dynamic invocation
  and avoids the need to compile.
  It is especially useful for exploring a few routines or 
  to invoke simple routines without having to think
  about the separate tasks of writing, compiling and 
  loading C code.
